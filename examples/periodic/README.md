# Installation

to run this example:
```
git clone https://github.com/JoaoLSS/react-native-background-worker
cd react-native-background-worker/examples/periodic
npm install
react-native run-android
```

You can change the constraints to see how the manager reacts, try switching airplane mode on,
and later (in foreground or background), turn it off.
